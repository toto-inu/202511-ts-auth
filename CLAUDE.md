# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a TypeScript authentication project using NestJS and JWT. The repository is currently in initial setup phase.

## Directory Structure

- `nestjs_jwt/` - Main application directory (currently empty, awaiting initialization)

## Getting Started

This repository appears to be newly initialized. Typical NestJS with JWT authentication setup would include:

1. Initialize NestJS project in the `nestjs_jwt/` directory
2. Install dependencies: `@nestjs/jwt`, `@nestjs/passport`, `passport-jwt`
3. Configure authentication module with JWT strategy
4. Set up environment variables for JWT secrets

## Notes

- This CLAUDE.md should be updated once the project structure is established
- Add build, test, and development commands once package.json is configured
